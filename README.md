# My-Kolkata-Map
This is a neighbourhood map of my city Kolkata

# My Neighbourhood Map project
In this project we are using Google Maps and Four Square API to load a map and data related to some venues on the map.We have markers at each of the venues and when we click on the marker an info window opens up giving us information about the respective venue.We also have a sidebar where we have a list of all the venues highlighted on the map.When you click on the venue name in the list the coresponding infowindow opens up and the marker bounces.We also have a search box where we can filter the venues to select the venue we want.The app is responsive across all device sizes.
